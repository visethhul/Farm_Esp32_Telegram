# Farm_Esp32_Telegram
I am working on an ESP32 project with the following setup:

- ESP32 with WiFi
- Telegram Bot for remote control
- SSD1306 OLED display (I2C, SDA=21, SCL=22)
- DHT sensor for temperature/humidity
- Ultrasonic sensors for tank/fertilizer level
- Relay module for controlling fertilizer pump

Main features:
1. Show dynamic status on OLED
    1.1. Status 1 (Internet :Connected or Disconnected \n Date : 01/10/2025 \n Time: 8:09 PM )
    1.2.Status 2 (Tank W: XX%,\n Pump : Activ or Stop \n,Temp: XXC, \n
    1.3. Status 3 (Tank F: XX%, Schedule: Active or disactive, Relay F: 10 Sec on 0r off \n ,Meter Water: xxxxL/Date ).
    noted : all of three Status show 20 sec loop
3. Control via Telegram bot commands (/status, /fertilizer_on_xx, etc.).
     3.1 commands /status how infomation  below
